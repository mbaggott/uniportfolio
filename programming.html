The program creates a series of images based on a calculation provided by the assessor. Each iteration of a loop adjusts the image output for the frame to be slightly different than the previous one. The output frames can then be put together in an animated movie, that will run for a short time.</article>

Also tested is user input validation, using loops, and custom exceptions. The program simulates a tour booking system for a travel agency, allowing customers to book in, assignment of customers to tours, and tour operators to groups.</article>

						<article class = "inline projectLabel wordWrap projectPadding">Description:</article><article class = "inline wordWrap projectDescription projectPadding">This is a large Object Oriented program that simulates a library management system. Written in two stages, the console element of the program provides the mechanics of the system, allowing a library collection to be established, and holdings in the form of books and videos to be added. Using the MVC pattern, a GUI has been added for user interaction. Such concepts as encapsulation and coupling rules have been observed during the construction of the program.</article>
